# CollectionBuilder-Sheets

CollectionBuilder-Sheets is a template for creating simple digital exhibit websites by loading collection metadata directly from a CSV (such as a published Google Sheet!). 
This enables live collaboration to prototype collections with minimal set up.
Driven by your collection metadata, the template generates engaging visualizations to browse and explore your objects.
The resulting static site can be hosted on any basic web server (*or built automatically and hosted for free on GitHub Pages!*).

Visit the [CB-Sheets demo site](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/collectionbuilder-sheets/) to see it in action and even test your own metadata!

To learn more check [docs/sheets-metadata.md](docs/sheets-metadata.md) or visit the [CollectionBuilder Docs](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/) for step-by-step details for getting started and building collections.

Note that CB-Sheets is based on and mostly compatible with [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-gh), but handles the metadata parsing in a fundamentally different way.

## CollectionBuilder 

<https://collectionbuilder.github.io/>

CollectionBuilder is a project of University of Idaho Library's [Digital Initiatives](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/) and the [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu) (CDIL) following the [Lib-Static](https://lib-static.github.io/) methodology. 
Powered by the open source static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and a modern static web stack, it puts collection metadata to work building beautiful sites.

The basic theme is created using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
Metadata visualizations are built using open source libraries such as [DataTables](https://datatables.net/), [Leafletjs](http://leafletjs.com/), [Spotlight gallery](https://github.com/nextapps-de/spotlight), [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes), and [Lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/).
Object metadata is exposed using [Schema.org](http://schema.org) and [Open Graph protocol](http://ogp.me/) standards.
