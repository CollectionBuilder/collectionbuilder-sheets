## About CollectionBuilder-Sheets

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-Sheets](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-sheets), an experimental template that directly parses CSVs to create small digital collection exhibits on GitHub Pages designed for teaching digital library skills.

Using CB-Sheets, it is possible to use a Google Sheets spreadsheet for your collection metadata, allowing you to see the outcome of metadata edits update immediately.

**This project is in progress and not fully functional!**

The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital). 

For full details of creating your own collection site, visit [CollectionBuilder Documentation](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/)!
